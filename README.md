# hello-world
Hello, I'm new here and would like to learn code. That's about it. My school doesn't really teach how to use computers despite student issued laoptops being an anchor to the common core curriculum. Not to worry, I have been teaching myself most everything for 2 years, why not coding? I honestly have nothing better to do.
